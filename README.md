# LociStories
The code for Loci/Stories installation exhibited with the National Trust at Seaton Delaval Hall, summer 2021. The installations is a prototype for a PhD project.

The code networks three machines that play video and audio content, triggered by voice interaction. 

The project is developed with Unity 3D and alongside Gavin Wood from Baawolf.

We suspect Unity has a bug with the VideoPlayer as occasionally, during installation time, the application does not load the videos and only plays the audio.
